  - text: My name is William MacKay and I am 62.
  utter_injury_story:
  - text: The back pain came on suddenly after I lifted a heavy bag of bark for my garden, out of the car boot 4 days ago. I dropped the bag of bark on the ground and had to go inside to ask my son to come and help me. I did not fall during this incident.
  utter_pain_location:
  - text: The pain is in left lower back region.
  utter_pain_description:
  - text: I have had occasional shooting with severe pain going down the back of my left leg. This happens more if I am sitting down.
  utter_pain_assessment:
  - text: It’s a constant pain all the time but occasionally gets worse. I would say it is worse in the morning but usually improves within 20 minutes after getting out of bed.
  utter_pain_medication:
  - text: Nurofen and Paracetamol tablets helped initially but not so much now
  utter_pain_better:
  - text: The leg pain eases if I am lying flat on my back or when I am standing.
  utter_pain_worse:
  - text: Sitting down too long, bending down, or lifting anything
  utter_pain_scale:

  utter_legs:
  - text: I have not noticed any leg weakness but over the last week I have had some pins and needles affecting the outer border of my left foot. I only have this left leg pain when I am sitting down

  utter_bowel_bladder:

  utter_daily_life:
  - text: My partner and son have been helping me around the house.
  utter_blood_mucus:
  - text: I do not cough any mucus up and have not coughed any blood up.
  utter_cough:
  - text: I have had a cough, but it is no worse than usual and I think it is because of my smoking
  utter_chest_pains:
  - text: I have not have any chest pains or palpitations.
  utter_breathing:
  - text: I have not have any wheeze or noticed any breathlessness when lying flat. However, I do get breathless if I am walking upstairs or up an incline, but this has been the same for years.
  utter_ankle:
  - text: I have not noticed any ankle swelling.
  utter_eating_problems:

  utter_diarrhoea:
  - text: I have not noticed any black diarrhoea.
  utter_past_problems:
  - text: I had an episode of back pain 5 years ago after a car accident and this cleared up with time and physio. I did not have any leg pain during that episode.
  utter_operations:
  - text: I had my gallbladder removed 10 years ago for gallstones. No problems with the anaesthetic.

  - text: I had high blood pressure diagnosed 10 years ago when I had my gallbladder problems. I see the nurse once a year for a check-up including blood tests.
  utter_allergies:
  - text: I do not have any allergies
  utter_current_medication:
  - text: Ramipril 1 tablet once daily for my high blood pressure. I also took Nurofen 1 tablet 3 times daily for the last 3 weeks. I bought this over the counter. Paracetamol (2 tablets/ 3 times daily) helps my back but not the leg pain.
  utter_live:
  - text: I live in Balmedie with my partner and son. The house is a 2-storey semidetached house which has stairs
  utter_work:
  - text: I am a self-employed cleaner, I work 7 days a week. My work involves cleaning machines and lots of bending down.
  utter_smoke:
  - text: I smoke 20 cigarettes per day since I was 15 years. I tried to stop 10 years ago when I was informed I had high blood pressure but nothing worked. I do not want to try anymore. I do not drink alcohol or take any recreational drugs.
  utter_family_conditions:
  - text: My mother died 10 years ago of a stroke at the age of 75. My father is 88 years old and is currently living in a nursing home. I do not have no siblings. I have a 35year old son, John, who lives with me. My partner has 2 adult daughters, Mary and Jean who live near Inverness.
  utter_hobbies:

  utter_pets:
  - text: No, I do not have any pets.
  utter_travel:
  - text: No, I do not have time with my job.
  utter_concerns:
  - text: I am really worried that I can't work because of the pain, and if I don't work I won't get paid. I already used all my savings so I really can't afford to miss work.
  - text: I am desperate to get rid of the pain and think some tests will find out what is wrong. I hope I can get an X-ray and some stronger pain killers.
